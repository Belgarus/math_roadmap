## Active vs Passive learning
**Learning happens in two main ways:** active and passive.  
For a long time, I leaned too heavily on passive learning and not enough on active learning—and that was a mistake.  
**Passive learning** is when you absorb information from external sources, such as listening to lectures or watching videos. While this approach can help you understand concepts on a deeper level, it’s almost useless if you don’t apply what you’ve learned.  
That’s where active learning comes in. **Active learning** means engaging directly with the material—testing yourself, teaching others, participating in discussions, and solving problems. These activities turn knowledge into skills, really outwears your brain and make learning stick.

## How to Think of Mistakes
I used to think that making mistakes was proof that I was stupid, but in reality, mistakes are what separate good students from great ones. Imagine your math knowledge as a circle: when you encounter a problem you can’t solve, you’ve reached the edge of that circle. Once you learn how to solve it, the circle expands.
Mistakes are valuable because they show you where your limits are—and every time you overcome one, you extend your knowledge.
