# My Opinion

The given Resources are brilliant and if you think their the thing your looking for - go for it.  

## What I will do Instead
I figured out that I want it a bit more specific.   
So I took the themes from the other Resources as inspiration and guidelines but choosed to reasearch them myself.  

## My Plan

``` 
 .
 ├── 1. mental arithmetic
 │   ├── master the basics
 │   ├── learn how to think logically
 │   └── learn advanced calculation skills
 ├── 2. fundamental math philosophie
 │   └── understand what the topic is
 -> learn algebra and calulus from the ground up
```
