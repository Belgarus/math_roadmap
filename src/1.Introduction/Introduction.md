# Introduction

## Why is it important to study maths?
**The [National Extension College](https://www.nec.ac.uk/insight/why-is-it-important-to-study-maths/) wrote following:**  
Maths is one of the foremost subjects for developing problem-solving skills and encouraging analytical thinking. These skills are valuable in a wide range of everyday scenarios.
From calculating expenses, analysing data, and making strategic decisions, a solid foundation in maths empowers individuals to tackle challenges effectively.

## Who am I?
I’m currently a student and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist in system integration. I completed basic German high school education (Gymnasium) but without the advanced level (Abitur).
I really struggled with high school maths, and even with a lot of learning, it was hard to keep up with the other students.  
I leaned the wrong way.

## So why do you want to teach me how to learn math?
I’m not here to teach math.  

My goal is to share my journey of getting better at math using mostly free resources and a bit of spare time. And I’m not just talking about high school math—I’m aiming for the level of a university math student.

Along the way, I’ve found plenty of resources created by brilliant mathematicians. But here’s the thing: they don’t always account for the struggles beginners face. That’s why I want to share my experiences—the wins, the setbacks, and the lessons—so you can learn from them and maybe avoid some of the same mistakes.

## How much time do I need?
As much time as you’re willing to invest. The more time you invest, the faster you’ll learn. But even over a longer period, you can and will improve your maths and problem-solving skills.
