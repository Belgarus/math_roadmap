# Free Resources

There are really a lot of resources.

## List of free Roadmaps and Courses

### 1. [OSSU Curriculum Mathematics](https://github.com/ossu/math)
A complete, degree-equivalent education in mathematics, crafted entirely from online materials. This structured curriculum is designed to meet the standards of an undergraduate math major, providing a clear learning path that typically spans two years. It's perfect for dedicated learners seeking a thorough and systematic foundation. It's mostly based on curses.

### 2. [Mathematics Roadmap](https://github.com/TalalAlrawajfeh/mathematics-roadmap)
Dive into mathematics through a carefully selected collection of books and exercises. This roadmap is more than a list; it's guided by a learning philosophy that emphasizes deep understanding, metacognition, and problem-solving. It’s an excellent choice for those who learn best by reading and engaging deeply with fundamental texts.

### 3. [Self Study Map Mathematics](https://tagvault.org/blog/self-study-map-mathematics/)
A thoughtfully curated collection designed to make mathematics accessible and engaging. This resource prioritizes pedagogical effectiveness and learner motivation over traditional, often overwhelming, textbooks. It's a shorter, high-quality starting point that helps you build momentum and enjoy the learning process.

### 4. [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Mathematics&q=Math&s=department_course_numbers.sort_coursenum)
MIT offers many of its mathematics courses online for free, including lecture notes, assignments, and exams. These resources are academically rigorous and ideal if you want to build a strong foundation or reach university-level proficiency in math. 

### 5. KI Roadmap 
AI topics. However, the quality can be inconsistent, and the content is often very shallow. These resources are best suited for very specific needs—not recommended for general learning or beginners.  
As an example: [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) Deep Research or [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/ai/course).
