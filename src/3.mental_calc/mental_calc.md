# Mental Calculation
### What is Mental Calculation?

Mental calculation (or mental computation) means performing arithmetic in your mind without using tools like paper, pencil, or calculators. People use it when tools aren’t available, when it’s faster, or in competitions. It often relies on special techniques and the decimal system.

### Can you flex with it?
Of course you can.  
During the 18th century, it was observed that children with strong mental calculation skills often became successful scientists or mathematicians, though some faced personal challenges. Individuals who perform complex calculations quickly and accurately are considered prodigies or savants, and have been called “lightning calculators” or geniuses.
